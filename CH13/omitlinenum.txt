               THE PEASANT, THE SNAKE AND THE FOX
00002
00003   Once upon a time, a peasant on his way home heard a feeble voice calling 
00004"Help! Help!" He looked round, took a careful step or two then realised that 
00005the sound was coming from beneath a large boulder. He asked in amazement: 
00006"Who's that calling?" And a voice replied,
00007   "It's me. The rock rolled down over my hole and I'm shut in. I can't get 
00008out, I'm going to die. Please help me. Move the boulder." The peasant then 
00009asked:
00010   "But who are you?"
00011   "I'm a poor snake," came the reply.
00012   "A snake? But if I let you out you will bite me."
00013   "No, no, I promise I won't. Get me out, please!" The peasant allowed 
00014himself to be persuaded and he shifted the boulder . . . and out of a hole in 
00015the ground slid a snake which darted towards the peasant and tried to bite 
00016him. The man jumped back and cried,
00017   "Why did you do that?" The snake replied, "Because every good deed is 
00018rewarded by an evil one, didn't you know that?"
00019   "No, I didn't. I don't think that's so," said the peasant.
00020   "Very well," said the snake. "Let's go and ask someone. If we come across 
00021someone who thinks as you do, well, that's it, but if people say I'm right, 
00022then I shall bite you. Agreed?"
00023   "Agreed," said the peasant, and off they went.
00024   A little later, they met an old mangy lame horse, thin and covered in 
00025scratches, with an uncombed mane and dirty tail. The peasant spoke to him.
00026   "Listen, friend. If someone does a good deed, what does he get as his 
00027reward?" Without a moment's hesitation, the horse replied.
00028   "A bad deed. Look at me! I served my master faithfully for years and now 
00029that I'm old, he has left me to die of starvation!" At these words, the snake 
00030turned to the peasant and hissed, "Did you hear that? I shall bite you now!" 
00031But the man exclaimed: "Wait! One question isn't enough! We have to ask 
00032someone else."
00033   "Bother!" exclaimed the snake. "Very well, let's look for someone else, but
00034wait and see, I'm right and I'll get my bite!" So, leaving the horse behind, 
00035the pair went on their way.
00036   They met a sheep which, at the peasant's question, said: "A good deed is 
00037always repaid with a bad deed. Look at me, I always follow my master and never
00038complain. I obey him all the time and what does he do? He shears my fleece in 
00039winter, so I feel the cold, and makes me keep it in summer, so I melt with the
00040heat!"
00041   "Get ready," said the snake, "I'm about to bite!" But the peasant said,
00042   "Please! We've had the first round, and the second one as well, now let's 
00043play the deciding round. If I'm wrong at the third question, then I'll let you
00044bite me."
00045   On they went, and in the wood, the peasant caught sight of a fox. Suddenly 
00046he had an idea. With an excuse, he left the snake on the road and ran into the
00047wood to speak to the fox.
00048   "Listen, fox, do you too think that a good deed is always rewarded by a bad
00049one?" 
00050   "Of course!" replied the fox. Then the man went on.
00051   "Well, listen, I'm going to ask you the same question in front of a snake. 
00052If you say that one good deed is rewarded by another good deed, I'll give you 
00053a present of a piglet, a lamb or a goose. How's that?"
00054   "Good," said the fox. The peasant went back to the snake.
00055   "I saw a fox over there," he said. "As you know, foxes are wise. Let's go 
00056and hear what he thinks about it." A little later they asked the fox the same 
00057question and the fox replied as had been agreed.
00058   "A good deed is always rewarded with another good deed, but," he went on, 
00059"why ask me that question?"
00060   "Because this snake, that I helped to escape from his hole blocked by a 
00061boulder, wants to bite me," replied the peasant. The fox looked at the snake 
00062and said, "Hmm! I think a snake can manage to slither under a boulder."
00063   "But it was a big boulder," the snake protested, "and, it was blocking the 
00064entrance to my den."
00065   "I don't believe you!"
00066   "Oh, don't you? Well come and see then," said the snake, setting off for 
00067his den with the fox and the peasant. Pointing to the boulder, he said, "See? 
00068That boulder fell just there," and he pointed to the entrance.
00069   But the fox shook his head. "A big snake like you couldn't get into such a 
00070little hole," he said. Annoyed, the snake retorted,
00071   "Don't you think so?" and slid swiftly into the hole. Then the fox shouted,
00072   "Quick, peasant man! Shut him in!" and the peasant rolled the boulder back 
00073across the mouth of the den, imprisoning the snake (and I think he's in there 
00074yet!).
00075   "Ah, fox," said the peasant happily, "now that was a good deed! You got rid
00076of that wicked snake for me! Thanks a million!"
00077   "Oh, it was nothing," replied the fox, "but don't forget that piglet, the 
00078lamb and the goose you promised me."
00079   "No, I won't. Come to the farm this evening and you shall have them," said 
00080the man.
00081   That same evening, the fox went to the farm, but the peasant appeared with 
00082two snarling dogs and a gun, shouting, "Get out of here, you horrible beast, 
00083if you don't want to get into trouble!"
00084   The fox trotted away, sad and disappointed, muttering, "and they say I'm 
00085cunning! The cunning one is that peasant. Oh, well, that poor snake was 
00086probably right, good deeds are repaid with bad deeds," and off he went, his 
00087tail between his legs, into the wood.
